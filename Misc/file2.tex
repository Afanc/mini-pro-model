The oscillator can be modeled following the molecular circadian clock in mammals : \\
Model proteins $Y$ and $Z$ act like the PER/CRY complex were PER is the product of the genes Per1 and Per2 and CRY of Cry1 and Cry2. This complex is built in the cytoplasm and re-enters the nucleus to inhibit an activator of Per1, Per2, Cry1 and Cry2 : CLOCK and BMAL1 (equivalent of $X$), both activating the upstream promoter sequence E-Box. This whole process concludes a negative feedback loop. \\
Furthermore, BMAL1 activates itself by the mean of proteins $\text{Ror}\alpha$ and $\text{REV-ERB}\alpha$ (mimicked by $V$ in our model) which link to a promoter of Bmal1.\\
